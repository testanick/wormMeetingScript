There are two scripts in this repository:
 * The final script that was used is labeled with -ALL- in the title. This script loops through the alphabetical author pages on the worm meeting website and pulls data from the html tables. 
 * The other file was for testing on a specific subset of the data (author's last name "T")
 
 Both files were written in/for Jupyter Notebook and will output a .csv file containing all author information for those presenting at the 2017 international worm conference. Output was then used to generate plots for a recent post on my website (June 9th, 2017) using the primary and secondary session assignment aspects of the data (i.e. what genre of talks are these).
